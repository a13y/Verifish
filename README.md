# Verifish

Verifish is a program designed to take well known or commonly used websites for phishing scams and generate fake domains using leetspeak. These fake domains are often used by phishers as their malicious website which are then blocked by Verifish as it uses the systems hosts or /etc/hosts file to block phishing.
